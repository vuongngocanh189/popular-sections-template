# Some section templates to use in designing website

Plan:

* CTA section with a heading, a subtext and a simple form to sign up (cta-form)

* A section with heading and text align vertically and horizontally ( info-align-section )

* A section to display 3 blog posts with thumbnails + title + extract (blog-thumb-section)

* A footer section with 3 columns and social icons (footer-section)

* A section that pulls content from rss (rss-section)

* A section for pricing

## CTA-form

CSS: Bootstrap, Open Sans font

* Background overlay (uncomment the .overlay style and <div class="overlay"></div> if you want to use this)
* Heading (h1) and subtext (p)
* Simple form that requires email only
