# Some section templates to use in designing website

Plan:

* CTA section with a simple parallax background, a heading, a subtext and a simple form to sign up (cta-form)

* A section with heading and text align vertically and horizontally ( info-align-section )

* A section to display 3 blog posts with thumbnails + title + extract (blog-thumb-section)

* A footer section with 3 columns and social icons (footer-section)

* A section that pulls content from rss (rss-section)
